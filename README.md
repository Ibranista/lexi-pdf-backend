# Number of days after which a refresh token expires
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS=30

# SMTP configuration options for the email service
# For testing, you can use a fake SMTP service like Ethereal: https://ethereal.email/create
SMTP_HOST=email-server
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=email-server-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=email-server-password
EMAIL_FROM=support@yourapp.com

# Public origin of this API, used to build absolute media URLs (TTS audio)
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OpenAI, via LangChain
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_TTS_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini-tts
# Languages a TTS voice actually exists for. `am` is deliberately absent:
# /ai/tts returns 200 with audioUrl omitted and the client hides "Hear it".
TTS_LANGS=en,ar

# Google Sign-In — every client id an idToken may be addressed to, comma
# separated: the Web client id (Android sign-in uses it) and the iOS client id.
# Leave empty and POST /auth/link/google answers 503 GOOGLE_NOT_CONFIGURED.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

# AI quota, counted in requests per user
AI_QUOTA_ANONYMOUS=10
AI_QUOTA_FREE=30
AI_QUOTA_PRO=1000

# Sync
SYNC_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES=2097152
SYNC_TOMBSTONE_DAYS=90
```

Without `OPENAI_API_KEY` the server still boots and serves everything except the
`/v1/ai/*` routes, which answer 503 `AI_NOT_CONFIGURED`.

## API Documentation

To view the list of available APIs and their specifications, run the server and go to `http://localhost:3000/v1/docs` in your browser. This documentation page is automatically generated using the [swagger](https://swagger.io/) definitions written as comments in the route files.

### API Endpoints

List of available routes:

**Auth routes**:\
`POST /v1/auth/register` - register\
`POST /v1/auth/login` - login\
`POST /v1/auth/refresh-tokens` - refresh auth tokens\
`POST /v1/auth/forgot-password` - send reset password email\
`POST /v1/auth/reset-password` - reset password\
`POST /v1/auth/send-verification-email` - send verification email\
`POST /v1/auth/verify-email` - verify email\
`POST /v1/auth/device` - register a device, get an anonymous session\
`POST /v1/auth/google` - sign in with a Google id token\
`POST /v1/auth/link/email` - turn the anonymous session into an email account\
`POST /v1/auth/link/google` - turn the anonymous session into a Google account

**User routes**:\
`POST /v1/users` - create a user\
`GET /v1/users` - get all users\
`GET /v1/users/:userId` - get user\
`PATCH /v1/users/:userId` - update user\
`DELETE /v1/users/:userId` - delete user

**Sync routes**:\
`POST /v1/sync` - push local changes and pull everything since the cursor\
`POST /v1/sync/merge` - fold an anonymous device's data into the signed-in account

**AI routes** (share one per-user budget; 402 `AI_QUOTA_EXHAUSTED` when it runs out):\
`POST /v1/ai/context` - upload extracted book text\
`POST /v1/ai/translate` - translate and explain a selection in its passage\
`POST /v1/ai/chat` - ask Lexi about the open document\
`GET /v1/ai/tts` - speak a word in the target language

**Suggestion routes**:\
`GET /v1/book-suggestions` - personalised reading suggestions (no auth)

### The reader API

Everything above `/v1/sync` implements the LexiPDF client contract. Three things
about it are worth knowing before changing any of it:

- **Identity is anonymous-first.** `POST /v1/auth/device` gives every install a
  real user row, so highlights and vocabulary work before there is an account.
  Linking upgrades that same row in place — there is no data migration path,
  because nothing ever has to move.
- **Sync rows carry two clocks.** `updatedAt` is the client's and decides
  last-write-wins; `serverUpdatedAt` is ours and drives the pull cursor. A
  device with a skewed clock can lose a merge but can never make rows invisible
  to other devices.
- **Lexi is scoped to one document**, enforced in the system prompt *and* by an
  output check in `ai.service.js` that refuses to put an off-topic answer on the
  wire. Document text reaches the model wrapped as untrusted data.

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism.

Controllers should try to catch the errors and forward them to the error handling middleware (by calling `next(error)`). For convenience, you can also wrap the controller inside the catchAsync utility wrapper, which forwards the error.

```javascript
const catchAsync = require('../utils/catchAsync');

const controller = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  // this error will be forwarded to the error handling middleware
  throw new Error('Something wrong happened');
});
```

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

The app has a utility ApiError class to which you can attach a response code and a message, and then throw it from anywhere (catchAsync will catch it).

For example, if you are trying to get a user from the DB who is not found, and you want to send a 404 error, the code should look something like:

```javascript
const httpStatus = require('http-status');
const ApiError = require('../utils/ApiError');
const User = require('../models/User');

const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const user = await User.findById(userId);
  if (!user) {
    throw new ApiError(httpStatus.NOT_FOUND, 'User not found');
  }
};
```

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Joi](https://joi.dev/). Check the [documentation](https://joi.dev/api/) for more details on how to write Joi validation schemas.

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the routes by providing them as parameters to the `validate` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const validate = require('../../middlewares/validate');
const userValidation = require('../../validations/user.validation');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', validate(userValidation.createUser), userController.createUser);
```

## Authentication

To require authentication for certain routes, you can use the `auth` middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const auth = require('../../middlewares/auth');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', auth(), userController.createUser);
```

These routes require a valid JWT access token in the Authorization request header using the Bearer schema. If the request does not contain a valid access token, an Unauthorized (401) error is thrown.

**Generating Access Tokens**:

An access token can be generated by making a successful call to the register (`POST /v1/auth/register`) or login (`POST /v1/auth/login`) endpoints. The response of these endpoints also contains refresh tokens (explained below).

An access token is valid for 30 minutes. You can modify this expiration time by changing the `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION_MINUTES` environment variable in the .env file.

**Refreshing Access Tokens**:

After the access token expires, a new access token can be generated, by making a call to the refresh token endpoint (`POST /v1/auth/refresh-tokens`) and sending along a valid refresh token in the request body. This call returns a new access token and a new refresh token.

A refresh token is valid for 30 days. You can modify this expiration time by changing the `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS` environment variable in the .env file.

## Authorization

The `auth` middleware can also be used to require certain rights/permissions to access a route.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const auth = require('../../middlewares/auth');
const userController = require('../../controllers/user.controller');

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/users', auth('manageUsers'), userController.createUser);
```

In the example above, an authenticated user can access this route only if that user has the `manageUsers` permission.

The permissions are role-based. You can view the permissions/rights of each role in the `src/config/roles.js` file.

If the user making the request does not have the required permissions to access this route, a Forbidden (403) error is thrown.

## Logging

Import the logger from `src/config/logger.js`. It is using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging library.

Logging should be done according to the following severity levels (ascending order from most important to least important):

```javascript
const logger = require('<path to src>/config/logger');

logger.error('message'); // level 0
logger.warn('message'); // level 1
logger.info('message'); // level 2
logger.http('message'); // level 3
logger.verbose('message'); // level 4
logger.debug('message'); // level 5
```

In development mode, log messages of all severity levels will be printed to the console.

In production mode, only `info`, `warn`, and `error` logs will be printed to the console.\
It is up to the server (or process manager) to actually read them from the console and store them in log files.\
This app uses pm2 in production mode, which is already configured to store the logs in log files.

Note: API request information (request url, response code, timestamp, etc.) are also automatically logged (using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)).

## Prisma & Utils

The app uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) as its ORM. The schema lives in `prisma/schema.prisma`, and a single shared client instance is exported from `src/config/prisma.js`. Two small utils in `src/utils` fill in for what Mongoose plugins used to do:

### exclude

`src/utils/exclude.js` strips fields (like `password`) from a Prisma record before it's sent in a response, since Prisma returns plain objects with no `toJSON` hook to do this automatically.

```javascript
const exclude = require('../utils/exclude');

const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });
res.send(exclude(user, ['password']));
```

### paginate

`src/utils/paginate.js` wraps any Prisma model delegate with pagination:

```javascript
const paginate = require('../utils/paginate');

const queryUsers = async (filter, options) => {
  const users = await paginate(prisma.user, filter, options);
  return users;
};
```

The `filter` param is a regular Prisma `where` filter.

The `options` param can have the following (optional) fields:

```javascript
const options = {
  sortBy: 'name:desc', // sort order
  limit: 5, // maximum results per page
  page: 2, // page number
};
```

The plugin also supports sorting by multiple criteria (separated by a comma): `sortBy: name:desc,role:asc`

The `paginate` method returns a Promise, which fulfills with an object having the following properties:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "page": 2,
  "limit": 5,
  "totalPages": 10,
  "totalResults": 48
}
```

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

In this app, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications. It also extends [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file. To modify the Prettier configuration, update the `.prettierrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

To maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs, the project contains `.editorconfig`
